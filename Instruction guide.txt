1) Insert the data path in the 31th line.
2) Insert the training file name in the 32th line to load the first k-fold set and insert the first test file name in the 34th line.
3) Insert the input variables in 37th line and the output variables in the 38th line.
4) The epoch number needs to be defined in 93th line.
5) The learning rate should be inserted in 97th line after 'lr ='.
6) Insert the number of hidden nodes in the 99th line after 'output_dim = ', the activation function related to the hidden layer after 'activation =' and the number of input variables after 'input_dim ='.
7) Insert the number of output nodes in the 100th line after 'output_dim = ' and the activation function related to the output layer after 'activation ='.
8) Run the code from line 10 until line 171.
9) Evaluate the results running the code from line 173 until line 259.
10) After finishing the all neural network computation for the first k-fold set, change the training file name in line 32 and the test file name in the 34th line for the names related to the second k-fold set.
Run the code using this new database. Do this step until all k-fold files were analyzed.

Note: the training and test set in this repository are not the original files used in this study, once the authors do not have permission to share data.
Due to that, fictional data were created to provide to the readers an example of neural network build using the code herein presented.
